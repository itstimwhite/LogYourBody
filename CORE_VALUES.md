# LogYourBody Core Values

These values define who we are, how we work, and what we stand for. They guide every product decision, feature development, and interaction with our community. Refined through a YCombinator lens to focus on building something people desperately want.

## ðŸŽ¯ Obsess Over User Outcomes, Not Features

We don't measure success by features shipped or users acquired. We measure success by users who achieve real body composition changes. Every line of code must move users closer to their goals.

**Why This Matters:**
Most fitness apps optimize for engagement metrics that don't correlate with results. We optimize for actual progress.

**In Practice:**
- Track user success metrics: body fat reduction, lean mass gains, goal achievement
- Ship only features that directly improve user outcomes
- Remove any feature that doesn't help users get results
- Build tools so effective that users can't imagine life without them

## ðŸ”¥ Be Undeniably Better

We don't compete on marketing or pricing. We compete by being so much better that switching to a competitor feels like downgrading. Quality is our only sustainable moat.

**Why This Matters:**
In a crowded market, the only way to win long-term is to be genuinely superior.

**In Practice:**
- DEXA-scan accuracy from phone measurements
- 30-second logging for complete body composition data
- Visual design that makes users feel proud to use our app
- Features that work flawlessly, not just impressively

## ðŸ“Š Science Over Stories

We base decisions on evidence, not feelings. Our metrics, methodologies, and recommendations must be scientifically sound, even when the truth is uncomfortable.

**Why This Matters:**
Users trust us with deeply personal health data. We must earn that trust through accuracy.

**In Practice:**
- Use only validated measurement methods (Navy, 3-site, 7-site calipers)
- Show realistic progress timelines, not motivational fiction
- Honest about measurement limitations and error margins
- No vanity metrics or fake motivation

## âš¡ Eliminate Friction Ruthlessly

Complex science should feel simple. Every interaction should feel obvious, fast, and rewarding. If users need documentation, we've failed.

**Why This Matters:**
Consistency beats perfection. Tools must be so easy that users never skip a day.

**In Practice:**
- Complete body metrics in under 30 seconds
- Smart defaults for 90% of users
- Progressive disclosureâ€”complexity available but hidden
- Remove every unnecessary tap, swipe, or decision

## ðŸ”’ Privacy as Competitive Advantage

Users' body data is deeply personal. We make privacy our differentiator by building trust through transparency and control.

**Why This Matters:**
Health data breaches destroy lives. Privacy builds unshakeable user loyalty.

**In Practice:**
- End-to-end encryption by default
- Users own their dataâ€”export and delete anytime
- Clear, jargon-free privacy policies
- Never monetize user data

## ðŸš€ Move Fast Without Breaking Users

We ship rapidly but never compromise user experience. Speed of iteration drives competitive advantage, but user trust is irreplaceable once broken.

**Why This Matters:**
YC companies win through speed, but health apps must be reliable.

**In Practice:**
- Weekly feature releases with thorough testing
- Real user feedback drives product decisions
- Transparent about what we're building and why
- Break our own code, never break user workflows
