-- This file is used to seed the database with sample data for development
-- Note: This will only run in local development environment

-- Insert sample user profiles (these will use auth.users IDs that don't exist in local dev)
-- This is just for testing table structure, not actual authentication

-- Note: Actual user data will be created through the authentication flow
-- This seed file is primarily for testing database structure and constraints

-- You can add sample data here for local development if needed
-- For example:
-- INSERT INTO profiles (id, email, name, gender, birthday, height) VALUES 
-- ('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', 'test@example.com', 'Test User', 'male', '1990-01-01', 175);

-- Note: The above line is commented out because it requires a valid auth.users ID
-- In actual usage, profiles are created automatically through the authentication system
