# LogYourBody

A comprehensive body metrics tracking platform with native iOS and web applications for monitoring health and fitness progress.

## Overview

LogYourBody helps users track their body composition changes over time through manual logging and automated data imports from DEXA scans, InBody analyses, and other body composition measurement devices.

## AI Issue Triage

This repository uses an intelligent AI-powered issue triage system. When you create a new issue, it will automatically:
- Analyze the content and recommend the best AI tool (Sweep, Copilot, or Claude)
- Add appropriate labels
- Comment with instructions

## Project Structure

This monorepo contains two main applications:

### üì± iOS App (`/apps/ios`)

Native SwiftUI application for iPhone that provides:
- **HealthKit Integration**: Syncs steps data with Apple Health
- **Body Metrics Tracking**: Log weight, body fat %, muscle mass, and measurements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- npm or yarn
- Xcode 15+ (for iOS development)
- Supabase account
- Clerk account

## Database Schema

The application uses Supabase with PostgreSQL. Key tables include:
- `profiles`: User profile information
- `body_metrics`: Weight, body fat %, muscle mass records
- `body_measurements`: Detailed body measurements
- `daily_metrics`: Steps and activity data

Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users can only access their own data.

## Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start web development server
- `npm run build` - Build web app for production
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Lint code
- `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript type checking
- `npm run ios` - Open iOS project in Xcode

## Deployment

### Web App
The web app is configured for deployment on Vercel:
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run build
```

### iOS App
The iOS app can be distributed via TestFlight or the App Store.
