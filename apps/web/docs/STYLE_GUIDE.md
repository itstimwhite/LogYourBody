# LogYourBody Style Guide

This guide defines the design principles and tokens used across our product. It serves as the single source of truth for our team and for any automated tools.

## Design Tokens

All colors, typography, spacing, and animation values are stored in `src/styles/design-tokens.ts`. These tokens power every component, ensuring consistency and accessibility.

## Brand Page

For the full color palette and typography details, see the [Brand Page](BRAND_PAGE.md). Use these values when creating new components or external assets so that everything aligns with our brand.

## Usage

- **Colors**: Reference tokens via helper functions (`getColor`, `tw` classes) rather than hardâ€‘coding values.
- **Typography**: Use the predefined token styles for headings, labels, and body text.
- **Spacing**: Leverage tokenized spacing values for consistent layouts.

Maintaining these guidelines ensures that our design stays cohesive as we scale.
