# PWA (Progressive Web App) Guide

LogYourBody is configured as a Progressive Web App, providing an app-like experience with offline capabilities, installation, and push notifications.

## Current PWA Features

4. **Offline Page** (`/public/offline.html`)
   - Styled to match app theme
   - Shows when offline and page not cached

## Testing PWA Features

### Development Testing
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/pwa-test
2. Check service worker status
3. Test install prompt
4. Test notifications

### Chrome DevTools Testing
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Check:
   - **Service Workers**: Should show sw.js as activated
   - **Manifest**: Should display app info
   - **Storage**: View cached files

### Lighthouse PWA Audit
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to **Lighthouse** tab
3. Select "Progressive Web App" category
4. Run audit

## Installation Testing

### Desktop Chrome
1. Look for install icon in address bar
2. Or wait 30 seconds for install toast
3. Click install and app opens in standalone window

### Mobile Devices
- **Android**: Chrome shows "Add to Home Screen" banner
- **iOS**: Safari > Share > Add to Home Screen

## Offline Testing

1. Install the PWA
2. Open DevTools > Network > Check "Offline"
3. Navigate around - cached pages work
4. Uncached pages show offline page

## Deployment Checklist

### Vercel Deployment
- [x] HTTPS enabled automatically
- [x] Service worker at root path
- [x] Manifest linked in HTML head
- [x] Icons accessible at root

### Production Requirements
- HTTPS (handled by Vercel)
- Valid SSL certificate
- Service worker scope at root
- Manifest with required fields

## Common Issues

### Service Worker Not Registering
- Check console for errors
- Ensure HTTPS in production
- Clear browser cache and retry

### Install Prompt Not Showing
- Must be on HTTPS
- User hasn't already installed
- Browser supports PWA installation
- Wait 30 seconds after page load

### Updates Not Working
- Service worker caches may be stale
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
- Clear site data in DevTools

## Future Enhancements

### Push Notifications
Structure is ready in service worker:
```javascript
self.addEventListener('push', (event) => {
  // Implementation ready
})
```

### Background Sync
Could add for offline weight logging:
```javascript
self.addEventListener('sync', (event) => {
  if (event.tag === 'sync-weights') {
    // Sync offline data
  }
})
```

### Enhanced Caching
Current: Basic cache-first strategy
Future: Network-first for API calls

## Monitoring

### Analytics Events
PWA events are tracked:
- Install prompt shown
- App installed
- Update available

### Performance Metrics
- Service worker registration time
- Cache hit rate
- Offline page views
