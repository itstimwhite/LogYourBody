feat: Complete codebase reorganization - Next.js to root, React to legacy

Major structural changes:
- Move Next.js app from /next-app/ to repository root
- Move original React app to /legacy-react/ folder  
- Update package.json name to 'logyourbody'
- Update all config files for new structure
- Clean up temporary files from React troubleshooting
- Preserve all original functionality and assets

The Next.js app is now the primary application while the React app
is safely preserved for reference and potential rollback.
