# Fastlane Match Setup Complete

Your Fastlane Match is now configured to use App Store Connect API authentication instead of username/password.

## Certificates Created

- **Development Certificate**: `9UJBLUW69K`
- **Distribution Certificate**: `8PRT68NL6X`

## Usage

### 1. Set Environment Variables

```bash
export APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH="$(pwd)/fastlane/api_key.json"
export MATCH_PASSWORD="your-secure-match-password"
```

### 2. Sync Certificates (Read-only)

```bash
# Development
bundle exec fastlane match development --readonly

# App Store
bundle exec fastlane match appstore --readonly
```

### 3. Force Refresh Certificates

```bash
# Development
bundle exec fastlane match development --force

# App Store  
bundle exec fastlane match appstore --force
```

### 4. Use in Fastlane Lanes

Your existing lanes (`alpha`, `beta`, `release`) will automatically use the API key authentication when you set the environment variables.

## Important Notes

- **No Username/Password**: The system is configured to fail if API key is not available
- **Match Password**: Required for encrypting/decrypting certificates in the git repository
- **API Key**: Located at `fastlane/api_key.json` - keep this secure!

## CI/CD Setup

For GitHub Actions or other CI systems:

1. Add `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH` as a secret
2. Add `MATCH_PASSWORD` as a secret
3. The certificates will be automatically synced during builds
