# Fix LiquidGlass Duplicate Declarations in Xcode

## The Problem
The Xcode project file contains references to BOTH:
- Old files: `LiquidGlassAccent.swift` and `LiquidGlassBackground.swift` (which no longer exist)
- New file: `LiquidGlassComponents.swift` (which contains all components)

This causes "Invalid redeclaration" errors because Xcode is trying to compile the same components twice.

## Solution in Xcode

### Step 1: Remove Old File References
1. Open LogYourBody.xcodeproj in Xcode
2. In the Project Navigator (left sidebar), look for:
   - `LiquidGlassAccent.swift` (likely showing in red or with an error icon)
   - `LiquidGlassBackground.swift` (likely showing in red or with an error icon)
3. Select BOTH files (hold Cmd while clicking)
4. Right-click and choose "Delete"
5. In the dialog, choose "Remove Reference" (NOT "Move to Trash")

### Step 2: Verify LiquidGlassComponents.swift
1. In the Project Navigator, navigate to the "Utils" folder
2. Verify that `LiquidGlassComponents.swift` is present
3. If it's NOT there:
   - Right-click on "Utils" folder
   - Choose "Add Files to LogYourBody..."
   - Navigate to `LogYourBody/Utils/LiquidGlassComponents.swift`
   - Make sure "LogYourBody" target is checked
   - Click "Add"

### Step 3: Clean and Rebuild
1. Menu: Product → Clean Build Folder (or press ⇧⌘K)
2. Menu: Product → Build (or press ⌘B)

## Expected Result
After these steps:
- ✅ No more "Build input files cannot be found" errors
- ✅ No more "Invalid redeclaration" errors
- ✅ Only `LiquidGlassComponents.swift` should be in the project
- ✅ The app should build successfully

## Why This Happened
When we created the consolidated file, we didn't remove the old file references from the Xcode project. Xcode keeps trying to compile files that no longer exist, and also tries to compile the consolidated file, resulting in duplicate definitions.

## Note
The `LiquidGlassComponents.swift` file in the Utils folder contains ALL three components:
- `LiquidGlassBackground`
- `LiquidGlassAccent`
- `LiquidGlassButton`

This is the only file that should be compiled.
