## ❌ Still Need to Do in Xcode

### 1. Add Files to Xcode Project
You need to add these files to the Xcode project:
- [ ] Add `Utils/DesignSystem.swift` to LogYourBody target
- [ ] Add `Services/WidgetDataManager.swift` to LogYourBody target

### 2. Update Widget Implementation
- [ ] Replace the default `LogYourBodyWidget.swift` content with the content from `LogYourBodyWidget_Custom.swift`
- [ ] Delete unnecessary default files:
  - `AppIntent.swift`
  - `LogYourBodyWidgetBundle.swift` (unless using multiple widgets)
  - `LogYourBodyWidgetControl.swift`
  - `LogYourBodyWidgetLiveActivity.swift`

### 3. Configure Widget Target
- [ ] In Xcode, select the LogYourBodyWidget target
- [ ] Go to Signing & Capabilities
- [ ] Add "App Groups" capability
- [ ] Add group: `group.com.logyourbody.shared`
- [ ] Ensure deployment target matches main app (iOS 17.0+)

### 4. Build and Test
- [ ] Build the main app first
- [ ] Build the widget extension
- [ ] Test on simulator/device
- [ ] Add widget to home screen
- [ ] Test deep links

## How to Complete Remaining Steps

1. **Add Files**: Right-click on appropriate folders in Xcode → "Add Files to LogYourBody..."
2. **Replace Widget**: Copy content from `LogYourBodyWidget_Custom.swift` to `LogYourBodyWidget.swift`
3. **App Groups**: Project settings → LogYourBodyWidget target → Signing & Capabilities → + Capability → App Groups
4. **Test**: Command+R to run, then add widget from home screen

Once these steps are complete, all features will be fully functional!
